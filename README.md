# ols1clk

========

## Description

ols1clk is a one-click installation script for OpenLiteSpeed. Using this script,
you can quickly and easily install OpenLiteSpeed with its default settings. We
also provide a **-w** parameter to install WordPress and a **-c** parameter to
install ClassicPress at the same time. Both must still be configured through
the wp-config.php page. A MariaDB database can also be set up using this script
if needed. If you already have a WordPress or ClassicPress installation running
on another server, it can be imported into OpenLiteSpeed with no hassle using the
**--wordpresspath** and **--classicpresspath** parameters. To completely install
WordPress with your OpenLiteSpeed installation, skipping the need for the
wp-config.php page, use the **--wordpressplus** flag. To install ClassicPress in
the same way, use the **--classicpressplus** flag. Both of these can be used with
**--wpuser**, **--wppassword**, **--wplang**, and **--sitetitle** to configure
each of the settings normally set by wp-config.php.
